Applications unleashed basically talks about the art of Application landscaping
It's essentially about filling the gap between what we want and what we can have


There are 5 blocks in this cluster and let's start with the first one.

1. All in a catalog
---------
This is about using SaaS solutions in the form of service catalog for specific bussiness functions instead of the traditional software development cycles.
To do so, we have to list down the basic functionalities and look for which SaaS solves it best
Business use : When we replace traditional methods we get cost effective .....
Technology : following aspects play import role to bring it life. 

Reborn in the cloud
-----
Reborn in the Cloud block determines the degree of Cloud feasibility and if feasible, the viable Cloud patterns – IaaS, PaaS and/ or SaaS as well as public, private, or hybrid.

Why?
Low cost

Business use?
Again, low cost - VMs instead of physical machines

Strategy?
Det. degree of feasibilty and patterns

Tech
IaaS : Skysight from Microsoft, AWS - Amazon.
Paas : GAE
Nov 2011: VDAB migration by capgemini using GAE


Elastic business
----------
This blocks aims at rapidly scaling up or down in response to the demand

Business use
“Elastic business” introduces a new business model that allows big enterprises to be more flexible and agile in the rapidly changing digital world. 
On-Demand resources let the customer to pay for what he used with no long-term commitments.

Tech
Adpotion of elastic architecture with scalable components and a support for real time scaling of the infrastructure automatically based on demand


API Economy
-------------
We are now moving into a new era of API first development. # of quora posts on "If ? has an API?" are going up?

Advantages
Faster dev cycles


Tech
Cloud SaaS
PaaS solutions
APIs access for services and data to allow rapid & independent innovations - good example : DeepDream - API access to Google’s Neural Network!

No App Apps
----------
The idea behind No App Apps is to reduce the time consuming requirement and interaction process between domain and IT specialists as much as possible by providing easy-to-use software development tools.

Business Use
Time and manpower for application building gets reduced because the domain specialist can easily build his own apps. No time consuming communication is needed. Therefore costs get reduced.

Technology aspects
A new and powerful class of application building tools is necessary, which use a catalog of UI, logic blocks and core applications that could be flexible combined and communicate via standardized APIs.
