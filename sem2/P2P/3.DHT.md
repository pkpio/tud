- Virtual servers

	One-one
	----
	- Why light nodes contact heavy NOT Heavy to light?
		- In steady state there will be more lights -> high traffic

	One-Many
	----
	- Directory based



- Thermal Dissipation based

	- Severa nodes in one interval : Chosen by f param
	- 3 ways

	1. 2f diff. nodes in interval and divide when nodes overloaded
		- 2f because f is reliability factor and we need it even after divide
	2. More than f but less than 2f.
		- Release some nodes to other intervals
	3,

- Address-space balancing



Reliability in DHTs
============
- Chord
	- Use f nearest successor clockwise instead of typical 1

- Redundancy vs Replication
	- Redundancy
		- Data split to fragments
		- Fragment copies maintained and have their keys
	- Replication
		- Each Data item is replicated K times
		- K replicas stored on Different nodes
			- They have same key and yet maintained by multiple nodes

- Stabilize fn

- Reliability
	- Data is replicated in successors as well
	- Node failed -> successors still have the info
	- Advantages vs Disadvan,

- Data replication
	- Security
		- More nodes have data so maj. polling incase of 1 malicious node
	- May be just store pointers in other nodes or same interval

	Diadvan.
		- Less # of intervals since more nodes per interval
