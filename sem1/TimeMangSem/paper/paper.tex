Time management is an asset and a liability. Lack of proper time management may put oneself on a depression feedback loop [1]. Time management is a melange of various aspects - scheduling tasks, execution and time line corrections, to name a few. Each of these aspects can be thought as a subproblem in our attempts to tackle the grand problem - Optimal Time Management. In addition to these subproblems, we must accept the fact that we live in a non-ideal world along with many others - shared space.  The paper presents a pseudo adaptive, suboptimal Time Management technique taking other players - shared space and non-ideal world, into consideration.

\section{Introduction}
% \IEEEPARstart
Time and Time Management are of paramount importance. This brings in an obvious urge to develop various techniques for an optimal time management technique. Starting from marking calender to a rigid time plan accounting for each hour of a day. There are a whole lot of techniques to make a basic plan, some of which will be covered in the existing literature section. One major aspect of time management is making a perfect schedule but an even more crucial part kicks in during its execution. There are several factors that could keep one from meeting their time plan. Stress, Bad planning, Lack of self control etc., which are mostly internal factors - in the sense that their correction is solely dependent on the individual. There are also external factors that could affect ones time plan - factors which the individual may not have anticipated or predicted at the time of planning.

The source of all the factors that affect time plans, broadly speaking, are a result of the fact that we live in a shared space where we are affected not only by our own actions but also by the choices of those around us and that we live in a non-ideal world where most events are probability based, not guided by any standard Uncertainty Principle, brings in more players into the equation. All these complex parameters would push any purely mathematical or conceptual approach to derive an optimal time plan into solving an NP-Hard problem [2]. One has to live with a suboptimal time plan for a given situation, iterate it based on their needs and arrive at an acceptable compromise between an ideal and executable plan.

The following contents of the paper are divided into four sections. Section II. Existing literature would focus on some of the existing techniques for Time management. Followed by Section III. Execution and Evaluation which is completely spanned by a case study where the subject employs an adaptive time management technique for their day to day activity for a fortnight. We will then conclude with Section IV. Conclusions, where would be highlighting the key aspects of our argument and how we derived or observed them in the case of the test subject.

\section{Existing literature}
There is plethora of research related to Time Management (TM) techniques and surveys depicting the outcomes of adopting or otherwise of a TM technique. [3], [4] and [5] centered their work around the impact of TM in an academic context, backing their claims through surveys with varying size of sample space and interpretations but similar outcomes. Time Management behaviors may have beneficial effects on tensions and job satisfaction but not on job performance. Contrary to popular claims, time management training was not found to be effective [6]. This controverts the hypothesis and findings of [7] and [8].

The common shortcoming in all these literatures is their failure to account that test subjects could be influenced by a plethora of external and internal factors. All these influencing factors, broadly speaking, are a result of Non-idealistic behavior and shortcomings of the test subjects and negative, intended or unintended, influence from peers, colleagues and other indirect players on test subject's attempts in keeping up with their schedule. Attempts have been made to evaluate the extent of influence by a common factor, tendency of procrastination, on the effective execution of ones time plan [9], [10].

\section{Execution and Evaluation}
We analyzed the day-to-day life executions of a test subject and how they divulge from their expected time plan. A qualitative note on the external factors causing the time-line diversion is also provided corresponding to each diversion.
